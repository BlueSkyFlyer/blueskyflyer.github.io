Ruby on Rails is a great framework for medium to large apps that require a database and signficant back end development. However, all of that power can be overkill for smaller, lighter web apps like the simple [Blackjack game](http://peaceful-ocean-7378.herokuapp.com) I created through Tealeaf Academy. Sinatra is the perfect candidate for creating web apps in Ruby with minimal effort.

##GETs and Redirects

Sinatra shines for web apps that don't have a large number of pages. The syntax used is very similar to HTTP requests and responses, so it is especially helpful for newer programmers. For example, in the case of Jack's Blackjack (the web app I created), redirecting the root path to a "New Player" template is as easy as:

{% highlight ruby %}

get '/' do
  redirect '/new_player'
end

get '/new_player'
  erb :new_player
end  

{% endhighlight %}

With only six lines of code we have processed a GET request for the root path, redirected to the '/new_player' page, and rendered the "new_player.erb" template. Of course, in the real application we will want to check for an existing player, set an inital pot amount, and more. Sinatra makes this easy too. 

##Session Level Variables

Let's say we want to check to see if there is already a Player Name registered on the session. If there is already a player, then we should route them straight to the game. Otherwise, we should continue on to register the new player. 

{% highlight ruby %}

get '/' do
  if session[:player_name]
    redirect '/game'
  else
    redirect '/new_player'
  end
end

get '/new_player'
  erb :new_player
end  

{% endhighlight %}

The session[:variable] is a straightforward way to check for session-level variables. Why might those be important? For a simple app like [Jack's Blackjack](http://peaceful-ocean-7378.herokuapp.com), setting up a large database system would be a lot of work for a relatively small reward. Session level variables elimate the need for a database and greatly simplify the app. As long as the user doesn't close the browser, the session will save the player_name and any other session level variables we specify. Awesome!

##Scratching the Surface

I'm sure it goes without saying, but this post barely scrathes the surface of why Sinatra is great for small, light web apps. Ruby on Rails is a fantastic tool, but not always the right tool for the job. If your app doesn't need presistent users, a database, or complex back end work then Sinatra might make your life a lot easier.
